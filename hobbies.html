<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>I love spending my free time creating different things. Anything crafty where I can explore my creative side. I have
    created and edited home family slide shows and videos, made some home decor using wood, and practically any other
    material what I can find in my household. Since my daughter was born I mostly create for her. Quiet book, puppet
    stage, themed birthday cakes just to mention a few. I love spending time doing something creative.</p>
